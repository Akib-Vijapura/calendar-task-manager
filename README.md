# Calendar Task Manager

## Project Overview

Calendar Task Manager is a React-based web application that allows users to manage their tasks in a calendar interface. Users can add, edit, delete, and view tasks, with features like categorization, search, and filtering.

## Functionality

- **Calendar View**: Users can view their tasks in a monthly, weekly, or daily calendar view.
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks with details like title, description, start time, end time, and category.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for tasks and filter them by category.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage for persistence.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calendar-task-manager.git
   cd calendar-task-manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Dependencies

This project uses the following main dependencies:

- React
- Material-UI
- date-fns

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `components/`: React components (Calendar, TaskForm, TaskList, etc.)
  - `pages/`: Page components (CalendarView)
  - `utils/`: Utility functions (localStorage handling)
  - `App.js`: Main application component
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the application

## Challenges Faced and Resolutions

1. **Challenge**: Implementing a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile.
   
   **Resolution**: Utilized Material-UI's responsive components and custom media queries to adjust the layout based on screen size. Implemented a collapsible drawer for navigation on smaller screens.

2. **Challenge**: Managing state across multiple components efficiently.
   
   **Resolution**: Centralized the state management in the CalendarView component and passed necessary data and functions as props to child components. For more complex state management in larger applications, consider using a state management library like Redux or React Context.

3. **Challenge**: Ensuring data persistence between sessions.
   
   **Resolution**: Implemented local storage functionality to save and retrieve tasks. This allows users to maintain their task data even after closing the browser.

4. **Challenge**: Handling date and time inputs across different timezones.
   
   **Resolution**: Used the date-fns library for consistent date and time handling. Stored dates in ISO format and converted them to local time for display.

5. **Challenge**: Improving performance with a large number of tasks.
   
   **Resolution**: Implemented efficient filtering and searching algorithms. For future improvements, consider pagination or virtual scrolling for the task list.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication for personalized task management
- Add support for recurring tasks
- Integrate with external calendars (Google Calendar, iCal)
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for easier task rescheduling
- Add data synchronization across devices
